# Database Change Management Process

All changes to production database schemas or server configurations must follow this process.

1.  **Request:** The developer or user submits a change request detailing what needs to change and why.
2.  **Review:** The DBA reviews the request and the proposed script for performance, security, and adherence to standards.
3.  **Approval:** The DBA and the requesting party's manager approve the change.
4.  **Scheduling:** The change is scheduled for an approved maintenance window to minimize user impact.
5.  **Deployment:** The DBA deploys the change to the production environment.
6.  **Verification:** The DBA and the requester verify that the change was successful and did not cause any unintended side effects.
