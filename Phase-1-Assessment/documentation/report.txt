1.  **(Immediate Priority)** Establish a standardized backup plan for all databases on this server. This includes daily full backups.
2.  **(High Priority)** Configure the `max server memory` setting to a safe value (e.g., 80% of the machine's total RAM) to protect the operating system.
3.  **(High Priority)** As a best practice, disable the `sa` login and ensure all administration is performed via integrated Windows Authentication.
