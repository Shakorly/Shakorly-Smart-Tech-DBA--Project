### 1. Strategy for Critical Production Databases

This strategy applies to all databases classified as "critical" to the business.

*   **Recovery Model:** Must be set to `FULL`.
*   **Backup Location:** All backups will be written to a dedicated backup drive/folder. For our server, this will be `C:\SQLBackups\`.
*   **Backup Schedule:**
    *   **Full Backups:** Once per week, on Sunday at 2:00 AM.
    *   **Differential Backups:** Once per day, Monday through Saturday at 2:00 AM.
    *   **Transaction Log Backups:** Every hour, on the hour, from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. 

### 2. Retention Policy

*   Backup files will be kept for 14 days and then automatically deleted.
