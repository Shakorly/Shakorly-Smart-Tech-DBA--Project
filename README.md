# End-to-End DBA Project for Shakorly Smart Tech Solution

This repository is a comprehensive, end-to-end project simulating the real-world tasks of a Database Administrator. 
It demonstrates best practices in database assessment, security, backup/recovery, performance tuning, automation, and documentation.

This project was built to serve as a professional portfolio piece and a hands-on learning guide.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into six distinct phases, each in its own folder:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment:** Discovering and documenting the environment.
*   **Phase 2: Standardization:** Hardening security and standardizing configurations.
*   **Phase 3: Backup and Recovery:** Building and testing a data protection plan.
*   **Phase 4: Performance Tuning:** Diagnosing and fixing slow queries.
*   **Phase 5: Automation:** Creating alerts and automated health checks.
*   **Phase 6: Documentation:** Consolidating all work into a central runbook.
